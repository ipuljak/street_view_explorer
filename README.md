## About
The Street View Tourist is a full-stack project that I created starting in December 2016. The aim of the project was to utilize and showcase some of my skills as a web developer. It contains a back-end that runs on node.js, and a front-end written in React. 

## Installation
To install, run:

`npm install`

To run the tests:

`npm run test`

To run the development server:

`npm start`

To run the production server:

`npm run build`

and then serve the build files using the server of your choice.
